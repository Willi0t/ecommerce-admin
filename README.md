<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project
![image](https://github.com/Willi0t/ecommerce-admin/assets/113394429/0fdee739-b174-4f13-a86a-46647f7f317b)


This project is an admin panel designed to function as a CMS for managing products in a webstore. It allows administrators to upload product details including titles, images, and descriptions, which are then displayed on the storefront of a separate project.

This e-commerce project consists of two separate applications: [E-commerce Front](https://github.com/Willi0t/ecommerce-front) and [E-commerce Admin](https://github.com/Willi0t/ecommerce-admin). The store offers a simplified tech shop experience, featuring a variety of merchandise including phones, tablets, and laptops. The admin panel, built with Next.js, provides a comprehensive interface for managing the store's inventory and processing orders. It allows administrators to easily add, update, and remove products, as well as handle customer orders efficiently. This dual-application setup ensures a smooth and efficient experience for both customers and store managers.

> **⚠️ Note:** The settings page is currently in development and is not yet functional .

</a>

I chose Next.js for this project because it’s a powerful framework for React that brings a lot to the table. First off, it offers server-side rendering and static site generation, which means our web pages load faster and perform better in search engine rankings. Additionally, Next.js simplifies complex tasks like routing and API handling.

</a>

For authentication, I chose NextAuth.js. It’s a complete open-source authentication solution for Next.js applications. NextAuth.js supports various authentication methods, including OAuth, Email, and Credentials. Its flexibility and ease of integration allow for secure user authentication and session management, which is crucial for an admin panel.

</a>

When it came to choosing a database, MongoDB was the clear choice. Its schema-less design means we can iterate quickly and adapt our data model as needed without a lot of hassle. MongoDB excels at handling large amounts of data and traffic, which is great for scalability. It’s also very developer-friendly, with simple queries and efficient data retrieval. This means we can focus more on building features rather than managing database constraints.

  <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Mongoose-white?logo=mongodb&color=%23a8dea0" alt="MongoDB Badge" style="width: auto; height: 30px;">
</a>

To interact with MongoDB, I used Mongoose. Mongoose provides a straightforward, schema-based solution to model application data. It offers powerful data validation, query building, and business logic hooks right out of the box, making it easier to work with MongoDB and maintain a structured data model.

</a>

For styling, I opted for CSS Modules. CSS Modules provide a way to write modular and reusable CSS, allowing us to scope styles locally to components. This prevents style conflicts and makes the codebase easier to maintain. The automatic and unique class name generation ensures that styles do not bleed into other components.
